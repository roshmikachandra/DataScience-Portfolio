# A potpourri of data science projects

My professional interest is in data science, machine learning, and data analytics.

## My background

My background is in the intersection of Economics, Sociology, and Computer Science. I have an MS in Economics (with a minor in Computer Science) from Drexel University and an MA in Sociology from University of Pune. I graduated from Drexel in June 2017. 

I have formal traininng (via coursework) in the following:

* **Regression methods and hypothesis testing** : Linear, logistic, and probit regression. Measure of accuracy like R-squared, Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision and recall. Statistical significance test for issues like multi-collinearity, ommited variable bias, and heteroskedasticity, and approaches to mitigate them. Concepts of bias-variance trade-offs, and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).

* **Time series analysis**  : Auto-regressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models, Vector autoregressive (VAR) and vector error correcting (VEC) models. Statistical tests and mitigation strategies for issues like non-stationarity, cointegration etc.  

* **Database management** : Relational algebra, Entity relationship diagrams (ER), SQL (PosgreSQL and MicrosoftSQL), schema refinement and normal forms, concepts of query processor and storage engine.

* **Algorithms**  : Sorting and searching algorithms, data structures (arrays, linked lists, and trees), graph algorithms (Prim, Kruskal, and Djikstra), algorithms for finite state automata, Turing machine etc.

I additionally have (both theoretical and practical) experience in the following machine learnig technology:

* **Supervised and unsupervised learning** :

* **Spectral analysis of data** :

* **Optimization methods** :

* **Large-scale machine learning tools** :
