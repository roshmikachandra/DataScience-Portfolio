# A potpourri of data science projects

## My background

My background is in the intersection of Economics, Sociology, and Computer Science. I have an MS in Economics (with a minor in Computer Science) from Drexel University and an MA in Sociology from University of Pune. I graduated from Drexel in June 2017. 

My professional interest is in data science, machine learning, and data analytics. I have formal traininng in the following.

* **Regression methods and hypothesis testing** : Linear, logistic, and probit regression. Measure of accuracy like R-squared, Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision and recall. Statistical significance test for issues like multi-collinearity, ommited variable bias, and heteroskedasticity, and approaches to mitigate them.

* **Time series analysis**  : Auto-regressive and moving average models, Vector autoregressive (VAR) and vector error correcting (VEC) models. Statistical tests and mitigation strategies for issues like non-stationarity, cointegration etc.
